To test the sample code, you need cocotb installed and a VHDL simulator. 

The makefiles are written for GHDL, but can be modified to work with other simulators. 
The installation guide for cocotb, GHDL and gtkwave, used for IN3160 course 2024, 2025 is included in markdown format. 

Installation can be done differently using the guides at https://docs.cocotb.org/en/stable/quickstart.html
